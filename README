To install, you will have to:
* Import install.sql
* Create a user for the database
* Set permissions for the user
* Set pool_update.sh to run at regular intervals (not absolutely required, but a good idea)
* Set some settings in www/includes/requiredFunctions.php

Graphs in statsAuth.php may not work unless you have PHP 5.3 (not 5.4).
It might work on 5.2, but I have not tested that.
